- 👋 Hi, I’m @dotnetnomad
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in general. If it comes to backend code, my preferred language is C#. For frontend I mainly worked with ASP.Net,HTML(no coding language 😉 ) and JS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular in a hobby project to get a better understanding of the SPA capabilities and the framework itself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on angular or any webdev project.
- 📫 If you want to get in touch, reach out to me: profonestone@gmail.com .
